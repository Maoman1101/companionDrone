[controls-description]
companion-construction-hotkey=Toggle whether the drone constructs, deconstructs, and repairs automatically.
companion-attack-hotkey=Toggle whether the drone defends itself automatically, or tries to avoid enemies.
companion-search-hotkey=Force the drone to do a fresh search of the area in the event it locks up and won't respond. Also prints some technical data on the drone's state for debugging purposes.

[settings]
set-challenge-mode=Makes the companion start out bad then get better over time, culminating in a much better drone than with this setting turned off. Take good care of your one and only companion you start out with! See the mod description for more details. New game strongly recommended, but it can drop in mid-save too.

companion-voice-lines=Do you want your companion to say little quips as it does stuff?

set-update-interval=How many ticks do companions wait before checking for new jobs? Lower = more responsive, higher = more performant. Note: setting this very low AND having many companions will probably tank your UPS. Recommend adding at least 2 for each companion you plan to have running simultaneously (i.e. two companions = 7, three = 9, etc). Default: 5

companion-idle-chatter-delay=Roughly how many seconds on average should Companion wait before speaking an idle phrase? Minimum: 5 seconds, default: 600 (ten minutes).

set-fuel-preference=Check the box if you want the companion to use your best fuels first (Uranium, rocket, jet, etc). Uncheck if you want the companion to use your worst fuels first (spoilage, wood, coal, etc).

set-mode=This setting has only four possible options, "0" "1" "2" and "3". \n\nLeave it at 0 for "normal mode" which doesn't have any of these additional features. \n\nEnter 1 for "challenge mode" with the drone starting out bad then slowly improving over time, eventually winding up even stronger than in normal mode \n(NOTE: new game recommended but not necessary). \n\nEnter 2 for "forgiving mode" which doesn't have progression but does have significantly easier recipes to make the drone suitable for complex overhaul mods such as angels or bob's. \n(NOTE: This mode is not recommended for vanilla, it is far too easy) \n\nFinally, enter 3 for "combined" mode, which combines 1 and 2 to give you easier recipes AND progression over time.
